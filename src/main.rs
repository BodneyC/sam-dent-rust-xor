        // This is why the streaming approach is often better when dealing with files out of your
        //  control - traditionally for this you'd `open` the file which would yield a pointer to
        //  your current location in the file, then `read` a chunk into a buffer, when you want to
        //  read more, use the same buffer and lose the previous chunk - the memory footprint is
        //  then only the size of the buffer
        //
        // In Rust (and other high level languages) you'd normally get a buffered-reader which does
